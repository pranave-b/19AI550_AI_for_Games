# Ex.No: 6  Implementation of Zombie survival game using A* search  
### DATE : 13.09.2024
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212221240040
### AIM: 
To write a python program to simulate the Zomibie Survival game using A* Search 
### Algorithm:
1. Start the program
2. Import the necessary modules
3. Initiate the pygame engine and window
4. Collect the Zombie image and resize it within a display window 
5. Create a Euclidean distance heuristic function to find the distance from current location to Target position
6.  Move the Zombie towards the target by A* search 
7.  In main, create the obstacles and move the player by Key movements up, down,left and right 
10.  Update the display every time 
11.  Stop the program
 ### Program:
```py

import random

# Initialize player and zombie positions on the grid
grid[player_x][player_y] = 1  # Player
grid[zombie_x][zombie_y] = 2  # Zombie

# Supply and escape route spawn
for _ in range(int(GRID_SIZE * GRID_SIZE * SUPPLY_SPAWN_RATE)):
    supply_x, supply_y = random.randint(0, GRID_SIZE - 1), random.randint(0, GRID_SIZE - 1)

        grid[player_x][player_y] = 1  # Reset to player position

    # Update game grid
    grid[player_x][player_y] = 1  # Player
    grid[zombie_x][zombie_y] = 2  # Zombie

    # Print game status
    print(f"Player position: ({player_x}, {player_y})")
    print(f"Zombie position: ({zombie_x}, {zombie_y})")
    print()
```
